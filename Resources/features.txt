Previous' syntax was smth like Rust

    fn name(type arg, type arg) -> ret {}
    let type name = 5;

Not sure if I wanna repeat it here

After thinking, probably I'll keep +- the same syntax, it's relatively
easy to parse, so why not (though -> for function definition might be
excessive)




One thing I'm sure of though, is that this one will be way simpler - 
I really overscope the previous one, block evaluation is fun of course,
but it's stupid to try to implement it on the first try lol

This one probably won't even have structs, just int/bool/float/string
